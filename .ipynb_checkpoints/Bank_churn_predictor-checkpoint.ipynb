    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal:\n",
    "    - The goal of this project is to develop a simple model which can use simple customer features to accurately predict client churn. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Utility: \n",
    "    - Identifying clients at high risk of churn gives us actionable intelligence in two phases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Potential Customer Identification: By being able to quantify which charateristics make a customer likely to stay or go we can more\n",
    "        tailor our marketing efforts to attract customers who are more likely to remain customers.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Utilize targeted marketing and retainment efforts at current customers who are higher risk of churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - We will be using a logistic regression model which classifies customers as secure (1), or likely to churn(0).\n",
    "    - There a few advantages of this model and approach:\n",
    "        - It is a simple model whcih can easily be tweaked or updated for future use.\n",
    "        - It is cheap to both build and maintain. \n",
    "        - It is intuitive, we input non complicated data about clients (age, gender, credit score etc.) and are able to make predictions with accuracy. "
